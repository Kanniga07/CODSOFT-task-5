This project is a real-time face identification system that recognizes faces in a live webcam video feed using Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model called the Haar Cascade classifier to analyze grayscale photos and identify faces. After analyzing every video frame, the algorithm looks for faces and highlights them with green rectangles. It has an easy-to-use interface with a live stream; the detection continues until the user hits the 'a' key to stop it. This project shows how to successfully use computer vision techniques for face detection.
